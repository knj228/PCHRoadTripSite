                    <p class="lead section-lead">How My California Coast Road Trip Began.</p>
                    <p class="section-paragraph">This winter break I went on a roadtrip with my girlfriend up the California coast by taking the famous Pacific Coast Highway. Along with a Canon, snacks and desire to be wowed by the beauty of nature, we headed out from Los Angles all the way to San Francisco and making stops on the way. Our First Stop Was
                     Piso Beach, where we stopped for Food at this local pizza shop. Once we were done stuffing our faces with Pepperoni, we headed on to Big Sur, hoping we could get there before the sunset.
                   We eventually got to a beach about an hour away from Piso and watched the Elephant Seals lay on the beach. We were starteled when two seals started to fight each other by hitting each other with their heads. As we continue down PCH, we get near ragged point
                  the PCH was closed due to a rockslide that occured earlier in the week, we had to turn around and drive 60 miles back to the nearest highway. After about 4 hours of driving on the non scenic highway, we reached our stop for the night, Monterrey</p>

                    <p class="lead section-lead">Monterrey, San Fran and More</p>
                    <p class="section-paragraph">As we Arrive in Monterrey, We are exhausted from all the driving. If I had to guess how long it took for us to get to Monterrey, I would say it took us around 7 hours to get there
                     but I would soon find out that it would all be worth it. Monterrey is a quaint beach town that is filled with little shops, all owned by residents of the town
                     After we arrived at our hotel, The Hotel Pacifica, we crashed into our bed and passed out. The next day we woke up at around 10 am and got breakfast at Denny's then went on a trip to the Monterrey Aquarium.
                     From the reviews and the price for the tickets, this was supposed to be one of the best aquariums in the world and to be honest, it was definetly worth it.
                     They had all types of fish, sharks, rays and everything in between. The tanks were huge, one was atleast 90 feet tall.
                    After our great trip to the aquarium, we went on to San Fran which was not a long drive compared to the drive from LA, just about 2 hours. The traffic in San Fran was crazy but after another 2 hours we finally got to our hotel.
                    After getting settled, my girlfriend treated me to a dinner at the Fogo de Ch√£o Brazilian Steakhouse. The steak, lamb and chicken was incredible
                  We stuffed ourselves and then returned back to our hotel to sleep it off. We got up next day and decided that because we had both been to San Fran before that we were going to try to see Big Sur and the rest of PCH that we did'nt get to see. It was a beautiful day
                 and me and my girl were excited about seeing the coast with the sun out since it had been raining on and off for the past couple of days that we were traveling. We made it to Big Sur and it was beautiful, then we made our way to Mcway Falls which was stunning.
                some of the roads that we were driving on were works of art, winding, turning, all so that we would stay in touch with the sea. We start to get near Ragged Point and we see a sign about a rockslide. Both my girlfriend and I looked at each other like
               ,"you can't be serious". So we could not believe that this was happening to us again especially since it had been a couple of days since said rockslide and we thought they should have it cleared by now since PCH is a major highway. We get to a sign that says the road is closed, with people parked on the shoulder wondering what to do since they don't want to drive the 80 miles back to Monterrey
               Seeing another driver just drive through a hole between the sign and the cones, we decided to see if it was really closed. So we keep driving through and we are getting closer and closer to ragged point but still about 15 miles away. If we can just get to ragged point, we can get on the next highway and off PCH. While on the road, we saw a couple of boulders on the road but they were pushed off on the side of the road like a construction crew came through there and cleared it out.
               We keep driving and it seems like we are going to make it until we approach a town with a state trooper car and another barricade of cones. We approach the barricade and the trooper comes on the loud speaker saying, "Turn back to Montterrey, Road Closed". So exhausted, my girl and I drive back to Moneterrey, get some In-N-Out and then leave for LA on the 101. After a stuggle to keep awake from driving so much
               we finally reached LA around 3 A.M. in the morning. My PCH trip was amazing and I would take the trip again when my girlfriend when we could drive up PCH all the way. If you want to see pictures from my trip make sure to click on the Photos Tab on the navigation bar</p>
